			<h1><i>Rereading the Riot Acts: Race, Labor, and the Washington, D.C. Snow Riot of 1835</i></h1>
			<h2>By Patrick Hoehne</h2>

			<image src="memorial.png" class = center></div>​​​​​​​​​​

			<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The voice of the
			sentry rang out in the darkness. From his station on the wall of the Washington
			D.C. Navy Yard, the man had spied the approaching danger. His report reached
			the commandant, and the drums of the Navy Yard began to beat a panicked tattoo.
			“<span class=SpellE>Evry</span> man,” recalled Michael Shiner, who was at that
			time an enslaved Ordinary Seaman at the Yard, “were at his post from the Roll
			of the drum.”<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn1' href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"

			mso-bidi-language:AR-SA'>[1]</span></span><![endif]></span></span></a> All
			hands prepared to mount a defense of the Yard, and the snarling mouths of two
			twelve-pound canons loaded with grape and canister protruded from the gate.
			Outside of the walls, in the city’s Sixth Ward, a large and hostile mob roared.
			It was Wednesday night, the twelfth of <span class=GramE>August,</span> 1835. </p>

			<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Two weeks had
			passed since white workers at the Navy Yard had gone on strike, protesting hard
			hours and poor treatment. Tensions burned in the August heat, and the strike
			soon morphed into a violent riot. Although they continued to threaten the
			officers of the Navy Yard, abolitionists, and the legal infrastructure of
			Washington, rioters directed the majority of their violence against the city’s <span
			class=GramE>African-American</span> population. The mob’s targeting of <span
			class=GramE>one man</span>, former slave and restaurant-owner Beverly Snow, led
			to the whole of the unrest being remembered as the Snow Riot. As Michael Shiner
			listened to the bellows of the angry crowd gathered beyond the walls of the
			Navy Yard, he was undoubtedly aware of the personal danger he faced. Still, he
			manned his post, and if he felt any fear, he did not record it. </p>

			<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The rioter attack
			on the Navy Yard never did materialize. Shiner hypothesized that “those fellows
			Jest done it for to <span class=SpellE>tantilise</span> <span class=SpellE>comanodore</span>
			hull they <span class=SpellE>hadent</span> no notion of <span class=SpellE>comint</span>
			to the yard.”<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn2' href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"
			title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:

			mso-bidi-language:AR-SA'>[2]</span></span><![endif]></span></span></a> For the
			rioters, Shiner reckoned, a show of force had been sufficient. “Thank god,” he
			concluded, “<span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>every thing</span></span> <span
			class=SpellE>wher</span> settled <span class=SpellE>peaceblelly</span>.”<a
			style='mso-footnote-id:ftn3' href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span

			EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA'>[3]</span></span><![endif]></span></span></a> There
			was no need for Shiner to mention that the African Americans who watched their
			homes, churches, businesses, and schools engulfed in flames were not so lucky.
			The ashes were testament enough. Still, no corpses littered the streets of the
			capital, and, at the orders of President Andrew Jackson, U.S. marines restored
			order to the city.</p>

			<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>It is perhaps the
			absence of this blood-and-thunder that has contributed to the diminished
			significance of the Snow Riot in the historiography of American rioting. As a
			race riot, the Snow Riot is overshadowed by the contemporaneous unrest in
			Cincinnati, New York City, and Philadelphia. Other than having the distinction
			of occurring in the nation’s capital, the prevailing scholarship generally
			paints the Snow Riot as just one of the hundreds of occurrences of extralegal
			group violence that erupted in the turbulent 1830s.<a style='mso-footnote-id:
			ftn4' href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
			style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]><span
			class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;
			mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:
			EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA'>[4]</span></span><![endif]></span></span></a>
			When the Snow Riot is remembered, analyses tend to be shallow and riddled with
			errors. While one historian mistook the entire affair for an episode of
			interracial working-class solidarity, most scholarship is content to present
			the Snow Riot as either identical to anti-abolitionist unrest in the urban
			North, or as an example of non-elite, non-slaveholding Southerners eagerly
			employing violence for the benefit of the institution of slavery.<a
			style='mso-footnote-id:ftn5' href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span
			class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]><span
			class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;
			mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:
			EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA'>[5]</span></span><![endif]></span></span></a> </p>

			<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>These
			interpretations are wrong. The Snow Riot possesses a significance largely
			unexplored by historians, and its mischaracterization has consequently
			distorted the prevailing theories regarding American popular extralegal
			violence. Unlike the race riots in Philadelphia or New York City, the
			Washington riot occurred in a slave city. The specter of slavery permeated the
			legal, social, and economic structures of the urban environment. It engendered
			a system where hierarchy, status, and categorization were both more important
			and more precarious than in Northern free cities. It cultivated an unstable
			ideology of violence defined by hierarchy and masculine control of others.
			Perhaps most importantly, slavery’s inescapable presence shaped daily life for
			every last one of the city’s residents. </p>

			<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>In the Washington
			Navy Yard, slavery was unavoidable by design. Capitalism intertwined with
			slavery to create a wage labor market especially vulnerable to exploitation and
			control.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn6' href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span
			class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]><span
			class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;
			mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:
			EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA'>[6]</span></span><![endif]></span></span></a>
			Officers deliberately deployed unfree labor and exacerbated racial divisions in
			order to control free workers and undercut demands for better pay or
			conditions. For white workers, this labor competition collided with the racial
			and social hierarchies of the slaveholding South, and economic insecurity
			mingled with status insecurity to create a volatile mix. </p>

			<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The white workers
			of the Washington Navy Yard hated black people and abolitionists. From the
			violence of the Snow Riot, this much is immediately clear. What is less
			apparent is the fact that those white workers were also opponents of slavery.
			For men who rioted in the August of 1835, these stances were not contradictory.
			The Snow Riot of 1835, rather than being conducted in defense of slaveholding
			Southern society, was the complex expression of the frustrations and objectives
			of white Navy Yard workers. Violence, in a city defined by Southern
			slaveholding, presented workers with the only means to simultaneously counter
			exploitation, assert their status, reorient the legal system in their favor, and
			crush their economic competition. The spark for this violence did not come from
			any abolitionist, rebellious slave, or restaurant owner, but rather stemmed
			directly from the marriage of urban slavery and wage labor capitalism.<span
			style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

			<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>In order to read
			the Snow Riot, the violence itself must be analyzed. Many riots, rather than
			acts of mindless destruction, are a form of violent communication. Unless
			extremely narrow in scope or veering into the realm of outright rebellion, most
			acts of extralegal group violence lack the power to completely achieve their
			objectives through the application of blunt force alone. Instead, most riots
			rely on a public and <span class=GramE>highly-symbolic</span> language of
			occupation, destruction, and violence in order to communicate their demands.
			Ritualistically defaced property or mutilated bodies are more than the
			unfortunate receptacles of a crowd’s rage, they serve as the canvas upon which
			the mob can inscribe threats, grievances, and demands. The subsequent response
			of authorities and targets to this violent communication is often what dictates
			the overall success of a riot.</p>

			<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Understanding the
			animus of a mob is, in part, understanding the individual’s perceived
			relationship to violence and the law. This relationship is shaped by power,
			conditions, and socio-economic realities, but is also directly informed by a
			cultural understanding of the individual’s position relative to society and
			government. Constantly changing external and internal forces ensure that this
			cultural understanding evolves over time. The “mob mentality” that animates a
			riot does not lurch around with bestial <span class=GramE>indirection, but</span>
			is rather a historical and cultural calculus shaped to address whatever forces
			or pressures supposedly necessitated the application of violence and
			circumvention of the law. </p>

			<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Deciphering this
			calculus means, in part, analyzing the Snow Riot in the context of broader
			trends occurring across the United States. The white mechanics’ deployment of
			extralegal violence as a tool of coercion and communication bore similarities
			to strategies employed by workers throughout the republic when confronted with
			exploitation or labor competition. Still, national trends do not fully explain
			the seething tension that possessed Washington in the summer of 1835. The local
			realities of Washington were unlike those in Boston, Philadelphia, or New York
			City, and not simply because of the city’s status as the national capital. Washington
			D.C. was a city of hierarchy, and deliberately cultivated an environment of
			spatial, racial, and social inequality that culminated, explosively, with the
			Snow Riot. </p>

			<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>In 1835,
			Washington was still younger than some of its residents, having been founded in
			1790. The man at that time occupying the White House, by comparison, had been
			born twenty-three years before Congress even designated the site as the future
			national capital. Still, Washington expanded rapidly, and by 1830 almost 19,000
			residents called the city home.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn7' href="#_ftn7"

			EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA'>[7]</span></span><![endif]></span></span></a> The
			residential patterns of Washington were not random, but reflected some of the
			structures baked into the city as a constructed space.<a style='mso-footnote-id:

			style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Most of the city’s residents lived along an
			artery of power that stretched from the White House to the Capitol [Fig. 1]. This
			section of the Pennsylvania Avenue constituted the heart of the city, and,
			consequently, the heart of the nation. Pennsylvania Avenue became an important
			stage for the symbolic representation of national power, authority, and prosperity.<a
			style='mso-footnote-id:ftn9' href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span
			class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]><span

			EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA'>[9]</span></span><![endif]></span></span></a> The
			federal government began to play a direct role in developing the national
			capital as the symbolic seat of American power and prestige. Impressive
			government offices, churches, banks, and hotels lined Pennsylvania Avenue, and
			elite Washingtonians settled nearby, both for convenience as well as public
			visibility. </p>

			<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Other institutions
			too were imbued with a symbolic visibility in the young capital. Alongside all
			those elegant buildings stood a string of taverns, markets, and slave pens where
			human lives were bought and sold alongside livestock. These pens were not
			hidden from the public view as embarrassing to the image of the emerging
			capital, but operated along Pennsylvania Avenue at some of the city’s busiest
			intersections, in plain view of the White House.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn10'
			href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
			style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]><span

			EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA'>[10]</span></span><![endif]></span></span></a>
			Those slave pens were not simply positioned for the sake of convenience, but
			were a symbolic representation of the political objectives of the slaveholding
			elite, both of the city and the nation. As historian Adam Costanzo writes,
			“defenders of the slave system also saw the capital as a proxy for the nation.
			During a long rebuttal to [William] Slade, Virginia Jacksonian James Garland
			encouraged Congress to protect the liberty and property of slaveholders in the
			District.”<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn11' href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11"
			title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:

			"Times New Roman";mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:EN-US;
			mso-bidi-language:AR-SA'>[11]</span></span><![endif]></span></span></a> The
			visible presence of slavery in the national capital was an important symbolic
			justification to counter abolitionist attacks on the expansion of slavery in
			the territories. For Washington’s own elite slaveholders, the arrangement of
			Pennsylvania Avenue affirmed their status at the top of the city’s racial and
			social hierarchies, and allowed ample opportunities for the cultivation of
			wealth, prestige, and control.</p>

			<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Washington’s space
			was intentionally used to affirm and enforce inequalities and hierarchies, both
			at a national and local level, but Pennsylvania Avenue still offered opportunities
			for non-elite Washingtonians. Proximity to the main artery of the capital could
			grant even marginal free residents the ability to find a measure of success.
			Smaller merchants, proprietors, and skilled and unskilled laborers lived and
			operated in the neighborhoods surrounding Pennsylvania Avenue, hitching their
			own prospects to traffic and expansion of the capital. Although lacking in
			substantial wealth or political power, some of these Washingtonians managed to
			quietly challenge the racial and social hierarchies that were supposed to
			define the city’s society. On the corner of Pennsylvania Avenue and Sixth
			Street, Beverly Snow, a mixed-race man, opened and operated a successful
			restaurant, the Epicurean Eating House. This symbol of black independence and
			entrepreneurial success stood just minutes from both the Capitol and Pennsylvania
			Avenue’s slave pens. </p>

			<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Still, not all of
			the city’s residents lived and worked in the area surrounding Pennsylvania
			Avenue, and a significant, largely working-class population inhabited the
			city’s peripheries. The corridor between the White House and the Capitol ran
			through four of Washington’s six wards, leaving two, the fifth and sixth wards,
			largely disconnected from the main channels of investment, power, and opportunity.
			As far back as 1804, Thomas Law wrote that “the public buildings, being placed
			at a distance from each other, created a division among the inhabitants; and
			the question has always been agitated, which end of the city would
			preponderate?”<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn12' href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12"
			title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:

			mso-bidi-language:AR-SA'>[12]</span></span><![endif]></span></span></a> In an
			attempt to remedy this issue, the city constructed the Washington Canal, which
			was intended to serve as an additional avenue of commerce and transportation. The
			canal flowed from Eastern Branch up through the Fifth and Sixth wards,
			proceeding north near Pennsylvania Avenue and ending in the Potomac River just
			south of the White House. This path, Law argued, would help alleviate the
			spatial imbalances of the growing city. “Unless this canal is formed,” he
			argued, “Pennsylvania avenue and other central streets will only promote the
			extremities of the city by having all their supplies from thence; but as soon
			as it is effect, the boarding houses, the houses of the public officers, the
			houses of ambassadors, the stores…and all will combine to create business and
			population.”<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn13' href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13"
			title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:

			<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Law’s reasoning
			was well-founded, but the canal itself was an utter failure. Waste, debris, and
			sewage clogged the waterway, making navigation difficult. Dredging this filth
			was expensive, and not done with enough regularity. The city did attempt to
			install a mud machine, possibly modeled after the one used in Baltimore harbor,
			but keeping the machine repaired and operational also proved difficult.<a

			<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Despite the
			failure of the Washington Canal, the southeastern wards were neither uninhabited
			<span class=GramE>or</span> lifeless. In the Sixth ward, the presence of the
			Washington Navy Yard, the city’s largest employer, facilitated the growth of its
			own residential neighborhood. Disconnected from the main artery of public life,
			the neighborhood was distinct in several ways. The Sixth ward was, by far, the
			whitest ward in Washington, and black residents constituted only 14% of the
			ward’s population in 1830. Every other ward in the city was at least a quarter
			black at that time, and, in the Fourth ward, 39% of the population was African
			American [Fig. 2]. The Sixth ward was also unique insofar that it had the
			second lowest estimated total property value in the entire city [Fig. 3]. Per
			capita, it had the lowest [Fig. 4]. Instead of banks, government departments,
			and hotels, the Sixth ward was home to a handful of taverns, poorer churches,
			and military buildings.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn16' href="#_ftn16"

			It is too late to help Beverly Snow, but it is not too late to answer this
			plea. Riots, no matter how seemingly mindless, are not random. Instead, extralegal
			violence like the Snow Riot is a form of communication. The communicative
			properties of the Snow Riot, when taken seriously, constitute an unspoken,
			kinetic manifesto of rioter grievances, demands, and logic. Southern extralegal
			violence remains only partially <span class=GramE>understood, but</span>
			adjusting the way in which we interpret violence could open new potential
			avenues for analysis. Antebellum riots occurred in New Orleans, Baltimore,
			Columbia, Charleston, and elsewhere throughout the South. As the country
			lurched towards civil war over the years which followed, these events, like the
			Snow Riot, may provide a window into the often-overlooked urban realities of
			pre-war Southern society. When we examine extralegal violence, we must not look
			solely at the superficial properties of riots, but instead “read the riot
			acts,” and attempt to analyze more seriously the symbology, language, and
			context of violence. </p>
