After waiting all afternoon for another deputy to arrive with the necessary papers and after \"a number of people assembled in a riotous manner\" they began to leave. At that point Arnold fired a pistol; 17 men in Indian dress appeared firing and marching after them. Sheriff Hogeboom thought it was only meant to frighten them. One of the Indians, along with Arnold, rode up to him and shot him dead. The Indians fled and the deputies retreated to Federalist Hudson and organized a posse. Thirteen men including Arnold were eventually arrested and placed in a heavily guarded jail. But with anti-Fed judges no one was convicted. Young says the conflict was Fed vs Anti-Fed.",

Their design being learnt, several citizens put themselves on board, to defend her in case of necessity, from the savages ofthe mob, who seemed bent on mischief and approached with drums and fife, and colours flying. As they attempted to get on board they were opposed, when a severe conflict ensued, and notwithstanding the vessel lay alongside the wharf, they were three times repulsed with broken heads and bloody noses. Mr. David Stewart [sic], Mr. Beeman, and several others who were on board, we learn, were very considerably wounded - but fortunately, no lives were lost.\"",

Morgan, James Milnor, Charles Hare). Among those present at the meeting: Commander Richard Dale, Col. James Read, Gen. Frances Gurney, Capt. John Dunlap, Samuel Wheeler, and Moses Lenny. An attempt by several hundred democrats with beating drums and colors flying to disrupt the meeting and get possession of the stage was driven off by the sailors. After the meeting the sailors paraded with Tranton through town. Democratic papers claimed the sailors were hired as conducted themselves in the style of British elections, where the minority try to put down popular rights.",

By this time the police Justices were alarmed at the size of the crowd and themselves searched the house. Reporting that nothing was found despite their search, from cellar to garret the crowd dispersed. The suspicons originally arosebecause of a prank delivery of a coffin to that address. When Kathy Butler refused delivery of a coffin to that address, the carriers left it in the yard temporarily and covered it up because of the rain. The practical joker was placed in prison because of debt - he had to pay for the coffin.",

Mickle went for the police but returned empty-handed. However, he rallied the gathered crowd, 200 or 300 behind him and counter-attacked. They beat the tenant, a Frenchman. The mayor arrived and installed the Mickles into the aprtment as the last peacable tenants. These are racial here as Mickle was probably Irish (he had shelelish (??) in his apartment).",

This did little to quell the disturbance. When the call for Caldwell was continued Holeman declared that Caldwell would never act on stage. Caldwell was brought in, Holeman insisted the question was privaate. Caldwell left and the crowd went wild. The ladies left and the theater was gutted. The appearance of the city guard did little and when they were armed the crowd just got worse. About 9:30 the people retired.",

It was limited and settled with the British officer bound to keep the peace. Thereafter it was noticed that the British ship had a tricolor tails on its vane. This was believed to be an insult to the N.O. French community. The next morning a crowd appeared and the mayor ordered the British officer to remove the vane. He did so, but in the afternoon, with an insurance from the US Army commander that the tails was not an insult to American pride, he hung it again. A mob rapidly formed and with the mayor present, who did nothing, took over the ship, cutting down the vane, rigging, chopping the main and mizzen masts, and firing into the cabin where the captain and British consul were . More damage would have been done had a detachment of the US infantry come up. 2 or 3 rioters were arrested, other were taken later as the mob dispersed.",

He was dragged from the bench, the mayor then being nominated. The discord was generating the orators of the day, GB Porter, James Buchanan and Benjamin Chonpaney making a general dirve for the tops of the Judges' desks. There was a general scramble for the high places, windows sills, pillars, tables, benches, and a general fisticuff ensued. The would-be speakers were shouted down and the target for flying inkstands, glasses and pitchers. This lasted for two hours.",

They pelted a public house with balls of lime flour and when some of their leaders were arrested by the watch in Hester street they attacked the watch and rescued them. They took a cross street to Courtland street. There they unsuccessfully attempted to knock down the iron railing. By then it was between 1 and 2:00am. Instead they overthrew a cart and broke some windows. They went up to the city Hotel where a ball was taking place. There the watch confronted them. But rather than making arrests and fighting with the crowd the watch gave way. The masses slowly dispersed.",
